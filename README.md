# Reliable Network Communication

This was my final project for a senior-level Data Networking course at the University of Oklahoma.
This project simulates network routing by using weighted routing cost and distances. The Stop and Wait protocol is used to ensure reliable transmission/reception using TCP connections using the WINSOCK API.

This project only runs on a Windows machineâ€¦
To execute this program, open a command line window for each instance of the routers. After that, you can open a window for each switch and host to execute. 
Open the commands.txt file and it contains the initialization for each router, switch, and host.

Pre-compiled executed for Windows7 can be found in HostSwitch/Debug

To send a data packet, enter the following command
ipaddr size 10
