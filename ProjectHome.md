This was the final project for my data networking class. This project implemented a host, switch and router program. These three programs worked together to simulate a computer network over a single computer. However, it is possible to run this over a network of multiple machines.

This project implemented the Stop and Wait protocol and ensured accurate data delivery of MAC frames.
